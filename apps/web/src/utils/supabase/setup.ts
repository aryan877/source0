===============================

1. BUCKET CONFIGURATION:
   - Bucket name: chat-attachments
   - Access: Private (for security)
   - File size limit: 10MB
   - Allowed types: Images, text files, PDF, JSON, CSV

2. REQUIRED RLS POLICIES:
   Run these SQL commands in your Supabase SQL editor:

   -- Enable RLS on storage.objects table
   ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Allow authenticated users to upload files
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads" ON storage.objects
   FOR INSERT TO authenticated
   WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'chat-attachments');

   -- Allow users to view their own files
   CREATE POLICY "Allow users to view own files" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT TO authenticated
   USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

   -- Allow users to delete their own files
   CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete own files" ON storage.objects
   FOR DELETE TO authenticated
   USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

   -- Allow users to update their own files
   CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update own files" ON storage.objects
   FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
   USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
   Make sure these are set in your .env.local:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

4. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Files are organized by user ID for access control
   - Signed URLs are used for temporary access
   - File type and size validation on upload
   - Private bucket prevents unauthorized access

5. USAGE:
   - Call setupSupabaseStorage() on app initialization
   - Use uploadFile() for single file uploads
   - Use uploadFiles() for multiple file uploads
   - Use createSignedUrl() for secure file access
